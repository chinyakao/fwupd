  "description": [
    "This system is missing the Microsoft SkuSiPolicy boot-service EFI variables that prevent using an insecure Microsoft bootmgr binary to disable secure boot.",
    "These variables are normally created by Microsoft Windows automatically, but on Linux-only systems they may be missing."

  "failure-impact": [
    "A local attacker could use an insecure bootmgr binary to disable secure boot and achieve arbitrary code execution of the early boot process.",
    "This allows running attacker-controlled payloads even when secure boot is enabled and configured correctly."
